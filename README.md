# Scientific Calculator – DevOps CI/CD Pipeline

This project is developed as part of the **SPE Mini Project** and demonstrates the implementation of a **DevOps-based CI/CD pipeline** for a Scientific Calculator application.

The calculator is implemented in **Java** and supports several mathematical operations. The project integrates multiple DevOps tools to automate important stages of the software development lifecycle such as **building, testing, containerization, and deployment**.

The main objective of this project is to implement a **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** that automates the process of building, testing, packaging, and deploying the application.

---

# DevOps Pipeline Overview

The automated pipeline performs the following steps:

### 1. Source Code Management

The source code is stored and version controlled using **Git** and **GitHub**.

### 2. Build Automation

**Maven** is used to compile the project and generate an executable **JAR file**.

### 3. Automated Testing

**JUnit** is used to execute unit tests that verify the correctness of the application logic.

### 4. Continuous Integration

**Jenkins** automatically triggers the pipeline whenever new code is pushed to the repository.

### 5. Containerization

**Docker** packages the application into a container image to ensure consistent execution across environments.

### 6. Deployment Automation

**Ansible** deploys the Docker container and runs the application automatically.

# Quick Start

Follow the steps below to build and run the Scientific Calculator application.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Preet018/SPE_Calculator.git
cd scientific-calculator
```

### 2. Build the Application

Use Maven to compile the project and generate the executable JAR file.

```bash
mvn clean package
```

### 3. Run the Application

Run the generated JAR file from the `target` directory.

```bash
java -jar target/calculator.jar
```

### 4. Run Using Docker

Build the Docker image.

```bash
docker build -t scientific-calculator .
```

Run the Docker container.

```bash
docker run -it scientific-calculator
```

### 5. Deploy Using Ansible

Run the Ansible playbook to deploy and start the container.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy.yml
```
